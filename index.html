      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>Hi there!</h3>
      <p>Hey there! If you’re here, you’re probably wondering who I am. Well, let me ease your curiosity—my name’s Muhammad Ahmad Khan, though most people just call me Ahmad. Since we’ve already crossed the introduction bridge, how about I share a little more about myself?<br> Well, since we're done with the introduction lets move on to the next part where I actually tell you more about myself.<br> I’m currently navigating the rollercoaster ride of being an A-level student in Pakistan.</p>
      <div class="more-content">
        <p>But beyond the textbooks and exams, there's a whole side of me that thrives on the outdoors.<br> I have this deep love for horseback riding—there’s something about the rhythm and connection with horses that makes it one of my favorite things to do. And, honestly, if it involves horses, I’m there! That’s not to say I don’t enjoy other sports. You can often find me on the volleyball court, swinging a tennis racket, or even in the middle of tent pegging training (it’s more intense than it sounds, trust me!).</p>
        <p>Of course, life isn’t just all sports for me. I have this natural curiosity for all things technical. I’m the type who loves to figure out how things work—taking stuff apart, solving problems—it’s like a mental puzzle I can’t get enough of. So, naturally, I’m leaning towards a future in engineering. Who knows what the future holds, right?</p>

      <p>Punjab? Khyber Pakhtunkhwa? Sindh? Gilgit-Baltistan? Balochistan?<br> You name it, I've been there. I’ve explored every province of my country—and yes, I absolutely love traveling. It brings out the real Ahmad within me; it’s a feeling of pure freedom.<br> Traveling isn’t just a journey—it’s an experience, one that's impossible to fully explain. Majestic is the closest word that comes to mind.<br>The mere thought of traveling takes me back to the places I've been. Let me share a few of my favorites:</p>
      <div class="more-content">
        <p>1. Gulmit, Hunza – I spent about two months here as an intern at The SilkRoute Lodge. Honestly, it felt more like family than work. The mountains, rivers, and glaciers—each with its own unique beauty—were simply perfect. One of my most unforgettable experiences was hiking the "Baskochi Trail," a three-hour trek up the mountain near Attabad Lake. The view from there? Absolutely breathtaking.<br>2. Ormara, Gwadar – A city that boasts one of the world’s most stunning beaches, with crystal-clear waters. The kind of place where you stand by the shore and the first words that escape your mouth are, "God really blessed this place with beauty." If you ever find yourself in the region, it's an absolute must-visit.<br>There are countless more, but let me tell you about one particularly memorable adventure.<br>In 2019, during a trip to Hunza, we found ourselves stuck in Bagrot Valley. We hadn’t planned for this. After reaching the valley with the help of a kind local, we realized the road to our hotel was blocked due to rain and landslides. It was late, and we were stranded. Fortunately, we found a small shop with three locals who went out of their way to help us. One of them spent hours, from midnight to 3 AM, calling around to find us a place to stay. Eventually, the headmaster of the local school insisted that we not leave, as it was too dangerous due to the landslides. He arranged for us to stay with one of his relatives. They welcomed us warmly, offering fresh fruits like plums and apricots from their own trees.<br> Their hospitality was heartwarming. The next morning, despite their insistence, we politely declined breakfast, thanked them for their kindness, and continued on our journey.<br>In addition to these domestic adventures, I’ve also traveled abroad. One of the most profound experiences of my life was performing Pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.</p>
